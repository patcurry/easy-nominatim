# nominatim-test
I've made a webpage that will connect to the openstreetmaps nominatim api, pull in geojson data for searched locations, and add those data to a map background. This is a simplified recreation of the http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ site. It does not have the same number of features, only the parts I need for the WebGIS project. It is written with ES6 JavaScript, without jQuery.

Is there a way to just put this repo into my webgis repo? I don't want to rewrite anything, i just want to be able to work on this as a separate entity.
